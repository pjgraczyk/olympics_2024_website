# Olympic Data Visualization Project

## Overview

This project aims to create an interactive web application for visualizing data from the 2024 Olympics. It combines a FastAPI backend for data processing and API endpoints with a Vue.js frontend for user interaction and data visualization, including 3D visualizations using Three.js.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Pandas, Numpy
- Frontend: Vue.js, Three.js, Matplotlib
- Deployment: To be decided (e.g., AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku)

## Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

- Install Python and set up a virtual environment
- Install FastAPI, Uvicorn, and other required Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib)
- Install Node.js and set up a new Vue.js project
- Install Three.js and other required Vue.js libraries (e.g., Vue Router, Vuex)

## Step 2: Design the Data Model and API

- Identify the key data points to track (e.g., athlete name, event, medal, country)
- Design the data model using Pandas DataFrames
- Create the FastAPI backend to serve the data through RESTful endpoints

## Step 3: Implement the Data Extraction and Processing

- Write Python scripts to scrape or fetch the 2024 Olympics data from reliable sources
- Use Pandas to clean, transform, and analyze the data
- Store the processed data in a format suitable for the FastAPI backend (e.g., CSV, SQL database)

## Step 4: Build the Vue.js Frontend

- Design the user interface and layout using Vue.js components
- Implement the data visualization features using Three.js for interactive 3D visualizations and Matplotlib for static 2D plots
- Integrate the Vue.js frontend with the FastAPI backend to fetch and display the Olympics data

## Step 5: Implement Additional Features

- Add user authentication and authorization to allow users to save their custom views and analyses
- Implement real-time data updates to keep the website up-to-date with the latest Olympics results
- Provide sharing and collaboration features so users can discuss and compare their analyses

## Step 6: Deploy the Application

- Package the FastAPI backend and the Vue.js frontend for deployment
- Set up a hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Digital Ocean, Heroku) to deploy the application
- Configure the server, database, and any other necessary infrastructure

## Step 7: Test and Iterate

- Thoroughly test the application for functionality, performance, and security
- Gather user feedback and continuously improve the website based on user needs
- Maintain and update the application as new Olympics data becomes available
